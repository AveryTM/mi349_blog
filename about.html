                <h3>About the Me and my Blog</h3>
                <p>Hi everyone my name is Avery M and I would like to personally welcome you to my blog. I am only going to put the M down because I have been given the blessing of having not just 1, or even 2, but 3 first names which really confuses everyone I meet. This is a platform where I can “blog” about all the important things going on around the world or experiences in my life that I want to share. I like to help other people as well as make other people laugh, so that is my goal with each and every blog post, to inform and entertain.</p>
                <p>I currently work and go to school at Michigan State University and I am pursuing a B.A. in Information Science while working full time at MSUIT. This is actually my second time around at MSU. I originally graduated with a B.A. in Criminal Justice because I planned on going to law school. During this period at school I had a student job working with MSUIT’s AV/IT support team and when I graduated they offered me a job so I could take a break from school before I applied to law school. In a twist of fate, I ended up liking my new job so much that I decided not to go to law school anymore, but instead take classes at MSU again in a degree related to my current job.</p>
