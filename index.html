                <p>During the summer after my senior at MSU the only thing I needed to graduate was an experiential learning credit. I had tried to get some internships over previous summers, but due to the pandemic, my plans for that had been interrupted, so I decided that I would participate in a study abroad program instead. MSU has so many diverse study abroad programs to pick from that the choice was very difficult and a little overwhelming. After lots of research and careful consideration, I decided to go on a trip to Japan with the college of education. One of the biggest factors that swayed my decision was that my mom did a study abroad in Japan when she was in college and would always tell me about how fun and amazing of an experience it was. I thought that the program that I was a part of was incredibly well done. It was a 2 part program where in the spring, before we went to Japan, we acted as a host team for a group of Japanese college students who were visiting MSU from a sister program. We got to spend about a month with them, doing some pre planned activities like visiting schools as well as lots of free time where we could take them to do other activities around campus or michigan. After their time here was over, we were able to reunite and flip roles when we visited their university in Japan. I really enjoyed that aspect of the program where I was able to form personal connections with other college students, which I think really enriched a lot of the time I spent in Japan, compared to if we were just instructor led or if I was there as a tourist. I was also able to form amazing connections and friendships with the other MSU students that went on the trip. There was such a mix of backgrounds for the students compared to what I would normally see in my classes, it was a great opportunity to meet people I would probably normally never meet. It also helps that one of the MSU students who went on the trip, happened to be my future girl, now current, girlfriend. Below is an example day's schedule on the trip!</p>

                <p>Have you ever played the popular New York Times mobile and browser game Wordle? Released in October of 2021 by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle and purchased by the New York Times in January 2022, the Wordle is played by almost 2 million people a day. If you have ever played the Wordle and wandered into the stats section, you may have had the misfortune of meeting the infamous WordleBot, a ruthless cheat, who will always be better at the Wordle than you. What started as a fun idea to use math to try and determine the statistically best starting word, has evolved into a soul crushing, technological hubris of an algorithm.<br>Now that you have been introduced to the sham artist known as WordleBot, let me tell you why it has been cheating and you will never be able to beat the bot. To start, we need to be aware that the playing field is not level. There are 12,987 5 letter words in the English lexicon but the Wordle only pulls words from a pool of 2,309. For a human this is an impossibly large number of words to choose from but the bot knows, and only guesses from, the approved list of words. This means that, from the very start of the game, your chances of guessing the correct word are 0.0077% while the Bots are 0.04%, over 5.6 times greater.</p>
